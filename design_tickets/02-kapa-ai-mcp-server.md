# [Doc Search Agent]: Deploy Kapa.AI MCP Server

Our Documentation Search Agent will integrate with Kapa AI in our CHT-Docs website. This is a critical / foundational piece to our Documentation Search inside our Multi Agent setup.

[Build an MCP Server with Kapa AI](https://www.kapa.ai/blog/build-an-mcp-server-with-kapa-ai)
Potential URL: mcp.cht-docs.app.medicmobile.org

### Benefits

- As users keep interacting with Kapa AI inside cht-docs, and kapa ai refines it's context. 
  - Our Documentation Search Agent will wrap calls to a deployed MCP server to harness an already deployed Kapa AI agent that has mapped references in cht-docs and is gaining context at every use.
