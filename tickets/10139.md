# Description

There is no way to block creating contacts under muted places. This feature would add a way to hide the add person / add place button for muted places based on user permissions.

## User Stories

1. As a system administrator, I want to control whether users can create contacts under muted places so I can enforce proper workflow management
2. As a user with limited permissions, I should not see the add person/place buttons on muted places to prevent creating contacts in restricted locations

## Technical Context

**Components:**
- `webapp/modules/contacts`
- User permissions system
- Contact forms

**Existing References:**
- Muted workflow functionality
- Contact hierarchy

## Requirements

- Add user permission to control contact creation on muted places
- Hide add person button when permission is not set and contact is muted
- Hide add place button when permission is not set and contact is muted
- Maintain existing functionality for non-muted places

## Acceptance Criteria

- When a place is muted and user lacks permission, the add person button is hidden
- When a place is muted and user lacks permission, the add place button is hidden
- When a place is not muted, buttons display normally regardless of permission
- When user has permission, buttons display normally even on muted places
- Permission changes take effect without requiring app restart

## Constraints

- Must work with existing muted workflow system
- Compatible with current permission framework
- Should not break existing contact creation functionality

## Technical Considerations

- Implementation should add a new permission check
- The permission check should combine muted status with user permissions
- This requires medium experience with the CHT - understanding of forms, permissions, muted workflows, and webapp architecture

## Comments

**@andrablaj (2025-09-04):** Checking if @freddieptf is planning to work on this feature

**@andrablaj (2025-09-23):** Inquired about labeling as "Help wanted" issue for relatively new contributors

**@dianabarsan (2025-09-23):** Not suitable for completely new contributors. Requires medium CHT experience - knowledge of forms, permissions, muted workflows, and webapp changes.

**@jkuester (2025-09-23):** Clarified distinction between "Good First Issue" (for completely new people with sufficient details) and "Help Wanted" (clear implementation path, no major design questions). This issue is straightforward for someone familiar with the concepts.

**@dianabarsan (2025-09-24):** Agreed with distinction. Team has been using "Help Wanted" for "post-Good First Issue" level. Implementation approach: add a permission and hide the add button when permission is not set and contact is muted.
