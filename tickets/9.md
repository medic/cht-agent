## Description

@andrablaj caught a new Kapa feature about a [hosted MCP](https://docs.kapa.ai/integrations/mcp/overview)

That is pretty cool and worth investigating.

@sugat009 , this is interesting demo of what our Agent around the Kapa MCP looks like: https://docs.kapa.ai/integrations/mcp/guides/tutorial-build-an-in-product-agent

This hosted Kapa MCP is relying on Google Auth for users. We're just relying on IP per rate-limiting. 
Cool to see that our ideas got the main error-catching mechanism for LLMs correct: Rate-limiting
It would be great to not have to host it, but our rate-limiting implementation is probably better for low-use, no barrier entry.

We're still creating a lot of "wrapping" around the mcp tool calls, either way do we just embed the few kapa calls into ours or offload that. Turn our MCP into the proxy they have mentioned in the docs.

Let's discuss the pros/cons and options here.

Questions:
- How much do we want Google Auth infront of using this MCP? [Auth requirements](https://docs.kapa.ai/integrations/mcp/overview#authentication)
    - Does this impact down the line community users? Do we care about that right now?
- We will eventually have a Slack Conversation MCP that builds correlation context between Kapa's work and Slack discussions. Do we keep stacking MCP installs on some of the agents? Perhaps this is the example of proxy use (one mcp install for client) to a bunch of other mcp's.
- Our CouchDB Knowledge MCP probably fits somewhere in there next year
- Do we just deploy both, and have one of us use each one through the end of January and see our own implementation is useful or runs into maintenance headaches? We may have another MCP concept ready by then and can figure out what our larger architectural plan for multiple MCPs looks like
